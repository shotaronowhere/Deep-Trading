# Deep Trading Bot

A Rust-based trading bot that rebalances portfolio according to predictions across a set of markets, specifically targeting deep funding markets. The bot connects to Ethereum via WebSocket and interacts with market contracts to execute trades.

## Features

- Connects to Ethereum nodes via WebSocket (Optimism RPC supported)
- Interfaces with market contracts to fetch outcome data
- Portfolio rebalancing based on ML predictions
- Uniswap V3 integration for efficient token swaps
- Batch routing via Solidity contracts for optimized execution
